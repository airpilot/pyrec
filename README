pyrec (Record.py) let's you:

* Easily build immutable data structures
* Use more declerative-style programming
* Never have to write __init__ (for records, at least)
* Avoid concurrency bugs
* Reduce memory consumption when dealing with lots of objects

All in once easy-to-include source file.  Just "from Record import Record"
