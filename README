pyrec (Record.py) let's you:

* Easily build immutable data structures
* Use more declerative-style programming
* Never have to write __init__ (for records, at least)
* Avoid concurrency bugs
* Reduce memory consumption when dealing with lots of objects

All in once easy-to-include source file.  Just "from Record import Record"

see examples.py

But be careful, once you get hooked on Record, you'll use it
everywhere.  Python will never be the same to you.
